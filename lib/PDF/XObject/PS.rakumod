=comment adapted from [ISO-32000 Section 8.8.2 PostScript XObjects]

Beginning with PDF 1.1, a content stream may include PostScript language fragments. These fragments may
be used only when printing to a PostScript output device; they have no effect either when viewing the
document on-screen or when printing it to a non-PostScript device. In addition, conforming readers do
not interpret the PostScript fragments. Hence, this capability should be used with extreme caution and only
if there is no other way to achieve the same result. Inappropriate use of PostScript XObjects can cause PDF
files to print incorrectly.
